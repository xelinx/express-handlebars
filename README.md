# express-handlebars

Build a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM using the MVC design pattern.

The assignment was to create an 'Eat-da-burger' express application where you can create, devour, and delete 'devoured' burgers. I coded the application using the CatsApp from activities as a guideline. Heroku deployment had some issues, but was... fixed? The frustrating part was getting an error when I tried to run server.js despite the port listening in and working. I tried google searching the error to problem solve to no avail.
